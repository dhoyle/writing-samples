# David Hoyle Writing Samples
Here are a couple of sandbox tutorials I wrote at Hortonworks (which merged with Cloudera), and a tutorial I wrote for Google on using PostgreSQL with Google App Engine (I wrote the simple code samples in that one). There's also a user guide (IFU) I wrote for a Class II dental imaging device at DPI (which was acquired by Ormco).
