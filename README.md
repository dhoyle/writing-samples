## Technical Content
Included in this repo are: 
* The PDF version of the Visual Builder Studio [user guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-manage-development-process/index.html) I worked on recently at Oracle
* A couple of sandbox tutorials I wrote at Hortonworks (which merged with Cloudera)
  * [Installing and Configuring the Hortonworks ODBC Driver on MacOSX](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/Installing%20and%20Configuring%20the%20Hortonworks%20ODBC%20Driver%20-%20MacOSX.pdf)
  * [Refining and Visualizing Sentiment Data]()
* A tutorial I wrote for Google on [Using PostgreSQL with Google App Engine](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/UsingPostgreSQLonGoogleAppEngine.pdf) (I wrote the simple code samples in that one)
* A user guide I wrote at DataRobot (v1 for a brand new ML platform)

## Markdown/GitHub Samples
* [Owncloud Server quickstart guide](https://davidhoyle.github.io/github.io/) -- This is a GitHub pages site I created for a writing test. The assignment was to create a quickstart guide for Owncloud Server, author the content using Markdown, and publish the content using Jekyll on GitHub pages. The GitHub repo with the source files is here: [https://github.com/davidhoyle/github.io](https://github.com/davidhoyle/github.io)
* [Splice Machine documentation](https://dhoyle.github.io/splicedocs-jekyll/) -- I did some part-time consulting work for Splice Machine for about a year (2020-2021). Splice Machine was a scale-out SQL RDBMS, Data Warehouse, and Machine Learning platform that has gone out of business. I authored this content using Markdown and Jekyll.
