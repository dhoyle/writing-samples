# David Hoyle Writing Samples
## Technical Content
Included in this repo are: 
* The [PDF version](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/using-visual-builder-studio.pdf) of the Visual Builder Studio [user guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/visual-builder/visualbuilder-manage-development-process/index.html) I worked on recently at Oracle.
* A couple of sandbox tutorials I wrote at Hortonworks (which merged with Cloudera):
  * [Installing and Configuring the Hortonworks ODBC Driver on MacOSX](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/Installing%20and%20Configuring%20the%20Hortonworks%20ODBC%20Driver%20-%20MacOSX.pdf)
  * [Refining and Visualizing Sentiment Data](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/Refining%20and%20Visualizing%20Sentiment%20Data.pdf)
* A tutorial I wrote for Google on [Using PostgreSQL with Google App Engine](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/UsingPostgreSQLonGoogleAppEngine.pdf) (I wrote the simple code samples in that one).
* A [user guide](https://github.com/dhoyle/writing-samples/blob/main/DataRobot_User_Guide.pdf) I wrote at DataRobot (v1 for a brand new ML platform).

## Markdown/GitHub Samples
* [Owncloud Server quickstart guide](https://dhoyle.github.io/github.io/) -- This is a GitHub pages site I created for a writing test. The assignment was to create a quickstart guide for Owncloud Server, author the content using Markdown, and publish the content using Jekyll on GitHub pages. The GitHub repo with the source files is [here](https://github.com/dhoyle/ownCloud-quickstart).
* [Splice Machine documentation](https://dhoyle.github.io/splicedocs-jekyll/) -- I did some part-time consulting work for Splice Machine for about a year (2020-2021). Splice Machine was a scale-out SQL RDBMS, Data Warehouse, and Machine Learning platform that has gone out of business. I authored this content using Markdown and Jekyll. You can see my commits [here](https://github.com/dhoyle/splicedocs-jekyll/commits/Doc3.1/?author=dhoyle-splice).
